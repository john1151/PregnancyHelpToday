      <div class="container-fluid one">
        <p>Pregnancy cravings are irresistable urges to eat a woman may get while she is pregnant. The cravings can range from something sweet like chocolate or candy to stuff like meat or junk food. These pregnancy cravings can be triggered by hormonal changes in the body that usually start around the 1st trimester, and end around the 4th or 5th week.</p>
        <p>Pregnancy cravings happen to about 90% of women during their pregnancy.</p>
        <p>It is completely normal for a pregnant woman to have these intense cravings, unless they start craving strange foods or things that aren't food.</p>

      <h1 class="subheading" id="scrollspyheading2">Why do I get Pregnancy Cravings?</h1>
      <div class="container-fluid one">
        <p>While there is no exact reason, there are two main theories as to why women get them. One theory suggests it is because of the increase in hormones that can highten the sense of smell and taste. The increase of these hormones can make the woman feel more hungry than usual. </p>
        <p>The other theory suggests that it is the bodys way to signal a change in your nutrional needs.</p>
        <p>Some other reaons as to why a pregnant woman gets pregnancy cravings can be drawn back to a lack of vitamins, iron, or protein in the body.</p>
